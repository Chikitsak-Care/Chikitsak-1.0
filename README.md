## TITLE OF THE PROBLEM STATEMENT (AS MENTIONED IN THE SIH WEBSITE) :  
Primary health care in remote areas using Cloud medicine and Diagnostic Services

## DESCRIPTION
There is an acute shortage of health care in smaller towns and villages. The objective is to scale up of the existing telemedicine /call centre for doctors network to all subcentres using DTH or similar technology that allows two way communication and is not dependant on Internet Service Providers. All data to be held in a cloud server, Integrating cloud tech with Patient MIS and Aadhar authentication, in order to make it easy for patients belonging to low socio economic and educational backgrounds for safe keeping of medical records and also for accessing the databases by emergency medical technicians by merely using biometric / thumb impressions.

## PS NUMBER :  
MK91

## DOMAIN BUCKET :  
Healthcare & Biomedical Devices

## APPROACH/SOLUTION  :
Cloud Medicine and Diagnostic Service use digital technologies to collect medical and other forms of health data from individuals in one location and electronically transmit that information securely to health care providers in a different location for assessment and recommendations. This technology can be implemented at a remote scale area where diagnosis hubs are made available to the people of that respective area. These Local Hubs would house various devices for a check-up, monitoring and get the most possible physiological data about the patient. The same data is pooled locally and sent to the cloud which would be mapped against Patient's Aadhaar ID which can later be retrieved through the App by the patient. Diagnostic application software that acts as a platform for monitoring and analysing the collected data by health care providers to help in remote diagnosis of the patient and intervention alerts based on the analysis of collected data. These Health Reports are made available to the doctors in major Health care providers for taking up patients for diagnosing the disease and proceeding with further treatment. Once the doctor is assigned with a particular patient, he would be monitoring the same patient through the generated reports from the Local hubs on his dashboard and communicate with the patient through the App for the treatment. The treatment results could also be monitored with patient's regular check-ins at the local hub improving the treatment. These collected medical records could be made available to approved physicians in case of a medical emergency using Aadhaar Authentication.
